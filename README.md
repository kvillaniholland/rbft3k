# Running
- Make sure you have (https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/)[Docker for Mac] installed (You can find the installer here: https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac)
- Once Docker is installed, make sure it's running (the Docker icon will appear in your system menubar)
- Clone this repository
- In a terminal, run cd to the directory you cloned the repository to, and run `docker-compose up`
- It will take a few minutes to provision. When you see `Laravel development server started: <http://0.0.0.0:3000>` output, you can load the app at http://localhost:3000/
