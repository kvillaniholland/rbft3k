To Do:
x Restrict fights to 1 defend / 5 attack per day
x Make homepage with fight results and top 5
x Config vars for max attacks and defends
x Make API results (don't dupe this code)
x CSV Robot Import
x make csv import errors
x make csv import button
x make fighting algorithm
x username, not email
x Nginx (uses builtin php)
x App name
x make sure csv import is safe / clean up code
x MySql
x Homepage

- Cleanup passes
  x Use a code review tool?
  x cleanup docker stuff
  x ensure defensiveness
  x remove facades where possible
  x dumb Templates
  x dumb routes
  x Get rid of unused stuff
  x Alphabetize use statements
  x naming
  x style / comments / etc
  x as dumb controllers as makes sense
  x doublecheck functionality against list
  x todos
  x Test
  x remove opcache thing

- Write notes to go with delivery / documentation
  - test starting from 0
  - Should do pagination?
  - Larger project would mean moving fight & import logic out of controllers
